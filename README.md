# Covid - 19 - Analysis of X-Ray Images

This notebook uses ML to predict positive cases of Covid-19 given X-ray images. In total, there are 21165 samples divided into four main classes:

- Covid-19
- Lung Opacity
- Normal
- Viral Pneumonia

All the images are in Portable Network Graphics (PNG) file format and the resolution are 299x299 pixels. On this current update, the database currently holds 3,616 COVID-19 positive cases, 10,192 Normal, 6,012 Lung Opacity (Non-COVID lung infection), and 1,345 Viral Pneumonia images.
